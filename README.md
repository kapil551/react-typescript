# React + TypeScript

1. Why TypeScript + React?

    - With static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs as you're typing the code, than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime.

    - Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete.

    - Makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier.
